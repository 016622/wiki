::: tip Good to Know

> **Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files,** if some Windows functions aren't working or Windows crashes, use the System File Checker to scan Windows and restore your files.  (**NOTE:** This doesn't replace the fact that you **should** always make a system restore point before changing things)

:::

1. Open an elevated command prompt.
2. Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

```powershell
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
```

3. When it has completed type the following command, and then press Enter.

```powershell
sfc /scannow
```

4. A system restart might be required.
