# Auto-update some ReVanced Apps

1. Install [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
2. Download this [JSON configuration file](https://pastebin.com/raw/ZKjcdc0m) and import it into Obtainium.

> **_How do I verify it's safe?_** You can do Ctrl+F on the configuration file, search for `http` and check that all download URLs are pointing to the GitHub repositories [j-hc/revanced-magisk-module](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module) or [ReVanced/GmsCore](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore). Those repositories automatically build the APKs with the patches.

That's all. Obtainium will check when there is a new version of the ReVanced apps available.

Included patched apps:
