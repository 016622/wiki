## Enabling Dark Mode

4. JDownloader will prompt you to download and install the theme package, click Ok, and install.

5. If it's doesn't automatically, close and reopen JDownloader.

7. In the Advanced Settings search bar, type "color back".

8. Change all the whites and light blues to dark grey or black.

9. Go to the RGB tab and copy-paste the "222222" color code.

10. The "Color For Table Alternate Row Background" seems to bug out for some reason and not take the "222222" color code, to fix this, set it to some other color first, and then change it to dark grey or black.

11. Back on Advanced Settings, search "color fore", and change all the blacks and whites to white.

12. Finally search "color text", and change all the colors to white.

13. The only exception is the "Config Label Disabled Text Color" which should be set to grey, for example `666666`.

14. Restart JDownloader and your dark theme should be all set up.

15. Every time JDownloader updates, the color settings will be back to default, and it will look messed up, simply close and reopen JDownloader again, and the colors should be back to normal. You don't need to set it all up again.
